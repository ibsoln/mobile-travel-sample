== Application Features

We will do a code walkthrough of a sample Travel application for mobile platforms using Couchbase Mobile 2.5.
The app will allow users to search for and to make flight reservations.
Users will also be able to search for hotels based on specific criteria.
The mobile app will use the Couchbase Lite 2.5 SQL based query API with support for Full Text Search (FTS).
The app will sync documents with Sync Gateway 2.5 using a websockets based replication protocol.
Additionally, we will use a web version of the Travel Sample app that includes the ability to make flight reservations. Users are created through the web app.
Documents are persisted on Couchbase Server and seamlessly synced over to web and mobile clients through the Sync Gateway.
